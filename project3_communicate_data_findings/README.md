## Dataset

The Ford GoBike System Data is a set of informations about individual rides made
in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.The dataset consist of 183412 bike records with 16 columns, namely duration_sec, start_time, end_time, start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station longitue, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude, end_station longitue, bike_id, user_type, member_birth_year, member_gender, and bike_share_for_all_trip.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, we found that the bike ride is heavily dominated by men adults. Men usually travel for longuer durations than women and they mostly start their trip in the afternoon. The travel duration deacreases with age and the most aged riders are men. The majority of the trips start on tuesday, wednesday and thursday and the user type is highly dominated by subscribers over customers.



## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, we will focus on the influence of age on the duration, the relationship between bike share for all trip and member age category, the predominance of men and the predominance of subscibers, followed by the most dominant start periode of the day and the days in the week.

We first present the predominance of male, subscibers, followed by the most dominant start periode of the day and days in the week using pie plots. Then we use a scatter plots to show the influence of age on duration, finaly we use a barplot to show the proportion of bike share for all trip per member age category.
